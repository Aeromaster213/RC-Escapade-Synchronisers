# RC-Escapade-Synchronisers

We designed and built an RC car for the event:- **RC-Escapade**, organized by **TechManiacs**, the Robotics Club of our institute, as part of the techno-cultural festival **Tirutsava 2023** of **IIT Tirupati**.

<h2>The Process:-</h2>
The primary engineering limitation encountered during the car manufacturing process was the lack of access to specialized components typically used in professional RC race cars. Additionally, the project was subject to a restricted time frame of 15 days for both the design and construction phases, as well as a constrained budget of Rs.15000. Therefore, it was necessary to source and utilize domestically produced components while also salvaging certain pieces for the construction of the car.
